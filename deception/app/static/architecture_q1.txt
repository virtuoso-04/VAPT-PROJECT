Infrastructure Overview:
To create a business model for your users, and to create content for the business to build on.
The following example shows the content of the website, to be run on mobile phones. This content is generated using Android's Developer Mode. Note that the data that you get from the user's phone is not actually generated by the app, it is created by you. The data generated is then used by your mobile app to generate business apps. In this example, we are generating an app that is built on a mobile phone, the code for this app is in the file app.app.json .
Now that we have an example of creating an Android app in our project, let's take a look
