Vulnerability Assessment:
we are a small team and don't want to compromise our own core values. We are not going to be trying to "be the first to know" about how our game works, but instead we are looking to share our experiences and ideas about creating real-time business experiences that are both fun and informative for our community.
This is not to say we don´t love business experience, as we do. However, we believe in the power of storytelling and the ability to connect with our audience. In that spirit, our team has a strong desire to create a truly immersive experience that is engaging to our customers.
